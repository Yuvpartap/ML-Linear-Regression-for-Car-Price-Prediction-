Using Machine learning algorithm, Linear regression to predict the price of car 


# Machine Learning & Linear Regression
Machine Learning is field of training the machines to learn from the historic data and find a pattern in it which helps in various fields of prediction. 
Linear Regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm which is used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value of another independent variable.
Here the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable.

# Car Price Prediction  
We are given with carprices.csv dataset which includes the mileage, age and sell price of the car. We apply linear model on the mileage and age variables of dataset and predictied the sell price (dependent variable) of the car
